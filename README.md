# Electrical Engineering Portfolio – Dana

Hello! I’m an **Electrical Engineering student** at **Texas A&M University**, with minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. My academic and professional interests lie in embedded systems, wearable technology, and design in both hardware and software. I have hands-on experience in PCB development, UI/UX, game design, and educational technology, as well as exposure to machine learning and signal processing research.

I’m currently seeking a co-op or full-time opportunity to apply and expand my skills in a collaborative, engineering-driven environment.
